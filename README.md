# CleaningData
# This is the peer review assignment for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course. 

# Files:
# run_analysis.R executes the data preparation of the files contained in the UCI HAR Dataset, and conducts the 5 actions outlined in the project assignment:
# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#README.md provides an overview of the contents of this GitHub repository.

#Codebook.txt provides an updated explaination of the data and variables used.
